== Work Experience
* Raytheon
** Cyber Threat Analyst, June 2019 - Current
*** Proactively search for cyber attacks and gaps in security measures by leading hunts, acting as a Threat Hunting SME, and by developing training
*** Built training material for new threat hunters

** Software Engineer, May 2018 - June 2019
*** Lead an 8 month, 175K, research project, building a digital forensics tool for use in embedded communication protocols. I focused on building documentation, presenting to leadership, tasking a team of four and designing and implementing the user interface (Flask and Node.JS). This solution received a provisional patent. 
*** Designed and prototyped a satellite data reduction algorithm that finds interesting patterns within TLE data
*** Participated in a cyber rotation program (was one of the engineers chosen from Raytheon’s four business units)
*** Training
**** Built and taught MIL-STD-1553B and MIL-STD-1760 curriculum for an internal embedded security course.
**** Built cyber curriculum for interns and entry level engineers
*** Raytheon CODE Center
**** Conducted Red Hat and Windows hardening exercises
**** Managed automated patch management project where we used machine learning to prioritize required system and application patches
**** Worked with internal Raytheon programs to test for cyber resiliency and provided suggestions on ways to mitigate potential attacks

** Cyber Security Engineer Intern, January 2017 - May 2018
*** Avionic Security Network Mapper
**** Designed and implemented databases (SQLite)
**** Created an intuitive user interface (Flask)
**** Researched known avionic vulnerabilities
**** Assisted in program planning by writing and proofreading system requirements, budget documents, program proposals, and project demonstration documentation
**** Received a patent for our solution
*** GPS
**** Aided in securing systems by writing and deploying hardening scripts (using Chef)
**** Deployed system and application patching to classified and unclassified systems
**** Helped prepare material for weekly cyber security class
**** Wrote a Python program that looks for classified keywords in documents to help prevent data spills

* Colorado State University
** Research Assistant, September 2016 - January 2018
*** IoT Penetration Testing
**** Created Raspberry Pi network monitor for device classification and security vulnerabilities
**** Analyzed network traffic for vulnerabilities
**** Statically and dynamically analyzed device firmware
*** Wrote a Python script that pulls network data and puts the data into a logical structure to help during analysis.
*** Created websites for finished research projects
*** Wrote Python scripts to test the quality of transferred medical data

** Teaching Assistant, January 2016 - January 2018
*** Taught students concepts in Java, Python, HTML, CSS and UNIX
*** Coordinated review sessions and create study material to break down complex information into more manageable sections
*** Assisted professors with curriculum by creating and critiquing homework and labs assignments

== Personal Projects

=== Completed
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/geolocation/geolocationResearch.html[Android Information Gathering Tool] is a tool that gathers and sends location from an Android phone to a user interface.
Presented at the Women In Cyber Security Conference in 2017. 
* link:https://bitbucket.org/addymmoran/carmd/src/master/[CarMD] is a web interface that helps people understand OBD-II error codes. Node.JS, ExpressJS, SQLite, and Python were used to consolidate and display the relevant information to the user. 
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/FacialRecognitionHomeSecurity/facial_rec.html[Facial Recognition Home Security Tool] uses facial recognition to detect a home intruder. This project was completed as part of my operating systems class at Colorado State University. 
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/GarminClimbing/GarminClimbing.html[Garmin Watch Climbing App] is an app designed for the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro watch that records climbing statistics (for both bouldering and big wall climbing) that does not require the user to specify start/stop for each climb. 

=== In Progress
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/Cipher/CipherProject.pdf[Cipher Learning Tool] is a tool used to demonstrate various ciphers, explain the history of ciphers and help the users understand password security (in terms of how long it'd take go crack)
