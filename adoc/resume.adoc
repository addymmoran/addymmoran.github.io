== Work Experience
* Raytheon
** Cyber Threat Analyst, June 2019 - Current (100% remote)
*** Proactively search for cyber attacks and gaps in security measures by leading hunts, acting as a Threat Hunting SME, and by developing training
*** Designed and am currently prototyping a tool that monitors a company's digital footprint
*** Support the stand up of the Threat Hunting Services team by assisting in the development of the Concept of Operations (CONOPs), process documentation and training material

** Software Engineer, May 2018 - December 2019 (50% remote)
*** Lead an 8 month, $175K, research project, building a digital forensics tool for use in embedded communication protocols. My work focused on building documentation, presenting to leadership, tasking a team of four and designing and implementing the user interface (Flask and Node.JS). This solution received a provisional patent and will be integrated into two additional projects at Raytheon.
*** Designed and prototyped a satellite data reduction algorithm that finds interesting patterns within TLE data.
*** Participated in a cyber rotation program (was one of the engineers chosen from Raytheon’s four business units).
*** Training
**** Built and taught MIL-STD-1553B and MIL-STD-1760 curriculum for an internal embedded security course.
**** Built cyber curriculum for interns and entry level engineers
*** Raytheon CODE Center
**** Conducted Red Hat and Windows hardening exercises
**** Managed an automated patch management project where we used machine learning to prioritize required system and application patches
**** Worked with internal Raytheon programs to test for cyber resiliency and provided suggestions on ways to mitigate potential attacks

** Cyber Security Engineer Intern, January 2017 - May 2018 (50% remote)
*** Developed an avionic network mapper where I focused on full stack development (SQLite, Python 3, and Python Flask) and program planning and management. This solution has received a full patent and will assist in securing aircrafts by detecting human error, insider threats and supply chain threats. 
*** Used Chef to automate system hardening for satellite systems to prevent common cyber vulnerabilities and meet government and program requirements. 

* Colorado State University
** Research Assistant, September 2016 - January 2018
*** IoT Penetration Testing: Created Raspberry Pi network monitor for device classification and security vulnerabilities, analyzed network traffic for vulnerabilities and statically and dynamically analyzed device firmware
*** Developed a Python script that pulls network data and puts the data into a logical structure to help during analysis.
*** Developed websites for finished graduate research projects
*** Developed Python scripts to test the quality of transferred medical data

** Teaching Assistant, January 2016 - January 2018
*** Taught students concepts in Java, Python, HTML, CSS and UNIX
*** Coordinated review sessions and create study material to break down complex information into more manageable sections
*** Assisted professors with curriculum by creating and critiquing homework and labs assignments

== Personal Projects

=== Completed
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/GarminClimbing/GarminClimbing.html[Garmin Watch Climbing App] is an app designed for the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro watch that records climbing statistics (for both bouldering and big wall climbing) that does not require the user to specify start/stop for each climb. 
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/geolocation/geolocationResearch.html[Android Information Gathering Tool] is a tool that gathers and sends location from an Android phone to a user interface.
Presented at the Women In Cyber Security Conference in 2017. 
* link:https://bitbucket.org/addymmoran/carmd/src/master/[CarMD] is a web interface that helps people understand OBD-II error codes. Node.JS, ExpressJS, SQLite, and Python were used to consolidate and display the relevant information to the user. 
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/FacialRecognitionHomeSecurity/facial_rec.html[Facial Recognition Home Security Tool] uses facial recognition to detect a home intruder. This project was completed as part of my operating systems class at Colorado State University. 

=== In Progress
* Home Development Environment which will consist of a private git server (include CI/CD DevOps pipeline), docker repository, web server (LAMP Stack), TorBox and PiHole.
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/Cipher/CipherProject.pdf[Cipher Learning Tool] is a tool used to demonstrate various ciphers, explain the history of ciphers and help the users understand password security (in terms of how long it'd take go crack). Planned implementation Python 3, Jupyter Notebook and Django. 
* link:https://addymmoran.github.io/projects/GarminIntervalTraining/GarminWatchIntervalTrainingApp.pdf[Garmin Watch Interval Training App] is an app designed for the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro watch that vibrates to notify the user when to start an activity and when to take a rest.
