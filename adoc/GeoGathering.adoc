== Motivation 
* Goal: Build a tool that gathers and sends location from an Android phone to a user interface
* Target Audience: Law Enforcement

== How it Works
* Python Implant
** Gathers current location, current wifi connection (if applicable), surrounding wifi connections, and sent and received texts.
** If desired, sends emails every 5 minutes with updated information

* User Interface
** Parses location data to retrieve coordinates
** Converts coordinates to addresses
** Adds places pinpoints on Google Maps
** Parses wifi data to retrieve SSID and IP Address
** Updates objects after every update

=== Possible Distribution Methods
* Near-Field Communication (NFC)
* Spear Phishing
* Steganography

== Examples

== Planned Improvements
=== Python Implant
* Sends contacts and photos to user interface
* Conceal application icons and hide from search query
* Automate setup and distribution

=== Web Interface
* Color code Google Maps pins based off of source of coordinate (wifi vs pic vs call)
* Spoof IP address of Raspberry Pi server >> Add the ability to take photos, preview camera, take videos, and start microphone
* Add options to have different update methods and update durations
* Add authentication
* Track arrival times, time spent at a location, and the number of visits
