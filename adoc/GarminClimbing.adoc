= Garmin Watch Climbing App

:toc: left

== Motivation 
* Goal: Build a Garmin watch app that tracks heart rate, current height above ground (in feet) and cumulative feet climbed. 
* Target Audience: Climbers who own a Garmin Smart Watch

== How it Works
* Use the https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/[Garmin Connect IQ SDK (Monkey C)] to write logic and watch app UI


== Documentation
* Written Documentation

* Code is available for viewing on https://bitbucket.org/addymmoran/garmin_climbingapp/src/master/[BitBucket]


* Screenshots

== Current State/Status
* Once I got the app installed on my watch the altitude information was very inaccurate. After further research, it looks like most Garmin watches use GPS based elevation or barometric data (neither are very accurate for less than 15 ft change). This app may work for Big Wall climbing (anything above 15 ft off of the ground) but will not have accurate results for anything less. Due to the restrictions described, I will not be pursuing this project further but the code is still available in BitBucket for reference.
