      <hr class="my-4">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        Backcountry Perspective Photo & Video, LLC prides themselves in creating the best product possible.
        The following service agreement is purposefully written to not require a lawyer and to ensure it is understood and agreed upon by both parties.
        Although it is not written in "legalese", once this document has been signed it is a legally binding agreement.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Expectations</h3>
        <h5>Expectations of Backcountry Perspective (BP)</h5>
        Listed below are what you can expect of Backcountry Perspective and its employees.
        <ul>
          <li>Drone</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The drone pilot will be Part 107 Certified and, as such, it is their responsibility to know and abide by the Part 107 rules and regulations. Some of the rules that may impact filming:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Weather</b>: We are unable to fly in rain, snow, and heavy wind due to visibility restrictions, increased risk of injury, and the damage that could be caused to the drone.</li>
              <li><b>Location</b>: We are unable to fly the drone if the film/photography session is close to military activity, airports, National Parks, etc.</li>
              <li><b>Speed</b>: The pilot cannot fly faster than 100 mph</li>
              <li><b>Time of Day</b>: The pilot cannot fly before dawn or after dusk (+/- 30 minutes)</li>
            </ul>
            For many of these rules, we can submit an FAA Part 107 waiver, however, this process can take up to 90 days and the claim is not guaranteed to be approved.
            <li>We will always fly with at least a $1,000,000 insurance policy.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>BP Employee Safety</li>
          <ul>
            <li>BP employees will rig their own lifelines and safety equipment, unless the customer's employees are specifically trained to do so (proof will be required).</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h5>Expectations of the Customer</h5>
        Listed below are Backcountry Perspective's expectations of its customer.
        <ul>
          <li>Professionalism and acceptance of our policies</li>
          <li>Timely payments (see payment and scheduling policies below).</li>
          <li>Provide outline for video/photo shots and/or collaboration with BP to develop storyboard</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Image/Video Rights</h3>
        The customer owns the image(s) and video(s) to distribute as desired, however, Backcountry Perspective may use the content in future advertising and
        the customer agrees to give Backcountry Perspective the appropriate credit for any redistribution (i.e. using watermark, photo/video credit by tags, etc.).

          <li>50% Deposit (see Payments section for more details)</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Changes in Scope:</b> BP will strive for flexibility, however, BP is subject to adjust the price and schedule accordingly.</b><br>
        <b>Personalized service agreement:</b> will include the contents of this agreement, as well as, start/end dates of the project,
        contact information of both parties, deliverables, etc.</b><br>

        <br>
        <h4>Payments</h4>
        Backcountry Perspective accepts cash, certified checks, or card payments. Make payable to "Backcountry Perspective Photo & Video, LLC".<br>
        <b>Quote:</b> takes into account scope of project, equipment used, time and labor, length of video, travel costs (if applicable), etc.<br>
        <b>Deposit:</b> The deposit is transferable if the project is rescheduled, however, if the project is cancelled BP reserves the right to keep
        some or all of the deposit (see cancellation policy for additional details).<br>
        <b>Invoice:</b> Once the invoice has been sent to the customer, the customer has seven (7) days to send the full payment.<br>
        <br>

        <h5>Cancellation Policy</h5>
        The customer will give Backcountry Perspective written notice
        <ul>
          <li>seven (7) days prior to the first date of the shoot (specified in the personalized service agreement) to cancel (for filming in Colorado)</li>
          <li>fourteen (14) days prior to the first date of the shoot (specified in the personalized service agreement) to cancel (for filming outside of Colorado)</li>
        </ul>

        If the project is cancelled within the required amount of notice (specified above),
        the customer will get 50% of their deposit back (equaling 25% of the project total). If the project is cancelled with less than the required notice,
        BP will not return any of the customer's deposit.

        <br>
        <h4>Deliverable(s)</h4>
        Once BP has received the remaining 50% of the costs, BP will provide the customer with a link to the digital copies of the deliverables (agreed upon in service agreement) and the link will be active for 7 days.
        If the customer needs the link to be active for a longer amount of time, please email BP at <a href="mailto:contactus@backcountryperspective.co">contactus@backcountryperspective.co</a>.

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Failure to Comply</h3>
        If Backcountry Perspective, for any reason not described above, is unable to uphold their side of the personalized service agreement, the 50% deposit will be refunded.<br><br>

        <b>Mediation:</b> Backcountry Perspective strives for customer satisfaction, however, in the unfortunate case where there is a disagreement
        the customer and BP both agree to first go to mediation. Mediation is a process in which the parties meet with an impartial person who helps to resolve the dispute informally and confidentially.
        Mediators cannot impose binding decisions. The parties to the dispute must agree, in writing, before any settlement is binding. The parties will jointly appoint an acceptable mediator
        and will share equally in the cost of such mediation. The mediation, unless otherwise agreed, will terminate in the event the entire dispute
        is not resolved within thirty days of the date written notice requesting mediation is delivered by one party to the other at the party's last known address.
